## Overview

A guardian who loses his memory needs to "connect" all his memories together to be able to defeat the Great Evil. This game was made during the Kennedy 2024 Game Jam. This game is buggy and very unfinished but I am proud of being able to finish the game loop with an alright story all in a short timeframe.
